# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical integration issues in the README parser system that are preventing proper data flow and context sharing between components. The system currently has three main integration problems: CommandExtractor not inheriting language context from LanguageDetector, LanguageDetector having insufficient confidence scoring and source tracking, and ResultAggregator not properly integrating data flow between analyzers. These issues must be resolved to ensure the parser system functions as a cohesive unit with accurate language detection, command extraction, and result aggregation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the README parser, I want CommandExtractor to inherit language context from LanguageDetector, so that extracted commands are properly associated with their detected programming languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LanguageDetector identifies a programming language THEN CommandExtractor SHALL receive the language context for that section
2. WHEN CommandExtractor processes commands THEN it SHALL associate each command with the appropriate language context
3. WHEN multiple languages are detected in a README THEN CommandExtractor SHALL maintain separate command collections per language
4. IF no language context is available THEN CommandExtractor SHALL use a default "unknown" language classification
5. WHEN language context changes within a document THEN CommandExtractor SHALL update its context accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing README files, I want LanguageDetector to have improved confidence scoring and source tracking, so that language detection results are more accurate and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LanguageDetector encounters strong language indicators THEN it SHALL boost confidence scores appropriately
2. WHEN multiple language indicators are present THEN LanguageDetector SHALL aggregate confidence scores using weighted algorithms
3. WHEN LanguageDetector makes a detection THEN it SHALL track the source location and evidence for the detection
4. WHEN confidence scores are below threshold THEN LanguageDetector SHALL provide fallback detection strategies
5. IF detection sources conflict THEN LanguageDetector SHALL resolve conflicts using priority rules
6. WHEN source tracking is requested THEN LanguageDetector SHALL provide line numbers and evidence snippets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want ResultAggregator to properly integrate data flow between all analyzers, so that parsing results are complete and confidence scores are accurately aggregated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple analyzers produce results THEN ResultAggregator SHALL collect and merge all analyzer outputs
2. WHEN confidence scores are provided by analyzers THEN ResultAggregator SHALL aggregate them using consistent algorithms
3. WHEN data flow occurs between analyzers THEN ResultAggregator SHALL ensure proper sequencing and dependency resolution
4. IF analyzer results conflict THEN ResultAggregator SHALL resolve conflicts using predefined priority rules
5. WHEN aggregation is complete THEN ResultAggregator SHALL validate the completeness of integrated results
6. WHEN errors occur in any analyzer THEN ResultAggregator SHALL handle partial results gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive integration validation, so that I can verify the system works correctly end-to-end after integration fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify data flow between all components
2. WHEN end-to-end parsing workflow is tested THEN it SHALL process complete README files successfully
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation is performed THEN it SHALL complete without errors or warnings
4. WHEN integration validation runs THEN it SHALL test all component interfaces and data contracts
5. IF any integration test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure diagnostics
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN it SHALL generate a comprehensive integration report
