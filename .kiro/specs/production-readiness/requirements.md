# Production Readiness Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive production readiness requirements for the README-to-CICD system based on the detailed analysis in COMPREHENSIVE_APP_STATUS_REPORT.md. The system currently has a health score of 78/100 and is functional but requires critical fixes to achieve production-ready status with <5% test failure rate, stable memory usage, and complete integration.

The system has made significant progress with TypeScript compilation now successful (0 errors) and core functionality operational (55ms execution time), but requires systematic resolution of test reliability issues, memory management problems, and integration gaps to reach production standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Suite Stabilization

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a reliable test suite with <5% failure rate, so that we can confidently deploy and maintain the system in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL achieve <5% test failure rate (currently 21.5%)
2. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN the system SHALL NOT experience memory exhaustion errors
3. WHEN OrchestrationEngine methods are called THEN the system SHALL provide all required methods including getEventHistory(), getCircuitBreakerStatus(), and getQueueStatus()
4. WHEN MonitoringSystem is used in tests THEN the system SHALL be properly initialized before use
5. WHEN mock components are used THEN the system SHALL return consistent success responses for backup and deployment operations
6. WHEN VSCode extension tests run THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% pass rate (currently ~40%)

### Requirement 2: Memory Management and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want stable memory usage and optimal performance, so that the system can handle production workloads without crashes or degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large README files (>10MB) THEN the system SHALL NOT exceed memory limits
2. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL NOT experience JS heap out of memory errors
3. WHEN executing end-to-end workflows THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 seconds
4. WHEN processing multiple concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain stable memory usage
5. WHEN framework detection runs THEN the system SHALL achieve >0.8 confidence scores (currently 0.5-0.7)
6. WHEN YAML generation occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 2 seconds target

### Requirement 3: Code Quality and Technical Debt Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with minimal technical debt, so that the system is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint analysis runs THEN the system SHALL have <500 total issues (currently 3,126)
2. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have no unused variables or imports in production code
3. WHEN console statements are present THEN the system SHALL use proper logging instead of console.log
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the system SHALL maintain 0 compilation errors
5. WHEN code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain >90% coverage for all components
6. WHEN security audit runs THEN the system SHALL have 0 vulnerabilities

### Requirement 4: Complete Component Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want all system components to work together seamlessly, so that I can use the complete README-to-CICD workflow through the CLI interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLI commands are executed THEN the system SHALL connect to all core components (parser, detection, generator)
2. WHEN README files are processed THEN the system SHALL flow data correctly through parser → detection → generator
3. WHEN framework detection runs THEN the system SHALL properly integrate with parser results
4. WHEN YAML generation occurs THEN the system SHALL use detection results to create appropriate workflows
5. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL pass all 6 validation steps (currently 5/6)
6. WHEN error handling is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5: Production Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready system with proper monitoring, logging, and deployment capabilities, so that I can deploy and maintain the system in a production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive health checks and monitoring
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with correlation IDs
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL validate all configurations and dependencies
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and diagnostics
5. WHEN security scans run THEN the system SHALL pass all security validations
6. WHEN load testing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle expected production traffic volumes

### Requirement 6: Documentation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a new user or developer, I want comprehensive documentation and intuitive interfaces, so that I can quickly understand and effectively use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access documentation THEN the system SHALL provide complete API documentation with examples
2. WHEN CLI help is requested THEN the system SHALL display clear usage instructions and examples
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration examples and validation
5. WHEN troubleshooting is required THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools and guides
6. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL have setup guides and development workflows documented
