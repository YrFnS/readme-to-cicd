# README Parser Requirements Document

## Introduction

The README Parser is a core component that analyzes README.md files to extract structured project information. It serves as the foundation for automatically generating GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines by identifying programming languages, dependencies, build commands, testing frameworks, and other project metadata from README content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to extract programming languages from my README, so that the CI/CD generator knows which language-specific workflows to create.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a README contains code blocks with language identifiers THEN the system SHALL extract and return all unique programming languages
2. WHEN a README mentions programming languages in text (e.g., "This Python project", "built with JavaScript") THEN the system SHALL identify and extract those languages
3. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL return them as a prioritized list based on frequency and context
4. WHEN no programming languages are detected THEN the system SHALL return an empty languages array

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to identify project dependencies and configuration files, so that the CI/CD pipeline can include proper setup steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a README mentions dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.) THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize these dependencies
2. WHEN installation commands are present in code blocks THEN the system SHALL extract package manager commands (npm install, pip install, cargo build, etc.)
3. WHEN dependency versions or specific packages are mentioned THEN the system SHALL capture this information
4. IF no dependency information is found THEN the system SHALL return an empty dependencies object

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to extract build and test commands from my README, so that the CI/CD pipeline includes the correct execution steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README contains code blocks with build commands (npm run build, cargo build, make, etc.) THEN the system SHALL extract these commands
2. WHEN test commands are present (npm test, pytest, cargo test, go test, etc.) THEN the system SHALL identify and extract them
3. WHEN multiple build or test commands exist THEN the system SHALL preserve their order and context
4. WHEN commands include flags or parameters THEN the system SHALL capture the complete command syntax
5. IF no build or test commands are found THEN the system SHALL return empty arrays for these categories

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to identify testing frameworks and tools mentioned in my README, so that the CI/CD pipeline can configure appropriate testing environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing frameworks are mentioned (Jest, pytest, RSpec, etc.) THEN the system SHALL identify and extract them
2. WHEN testing tools or runners are referenced (coverage tools, test reporters, etc.) THEN the system SHALL capture this information
3. WHEN test configuration files are mentioned THEN the system SHALL note their presence
4. IF no testing frameworks are detected THEN the system SHALL return an empty testing object

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to extract project metadata and structure information, so that the CI/CD pipeline can be customized for my specific project setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project name is present in README title or headers THEN the system SHALL extract the project name
2. WHEN project description exists THEN the system SHALL capture a concise description
3. WHEN directory structure or file organization is described THEN the system SHALL extract relevant structural information
4. WHEN environment variables or configuration requirements are mentioned THEN the system SHALL identify these requirements
5. WHEN deployment or runtime information is present THEN the system SHALL extract relevant deployment context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to handle various README formats and edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably across different project styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README uses different markdown syntax variations THEN the system SHALL parse content correctly
2. WHEN README contains malformed or incomplete sections THEN the system SHALL continue processing and return partial results
3. WHEN README is very large or very small THEN the system SHALL handle the content appropriately without errors
4. WHEN README contains non-English content mixed with technical terms THEN the system SHALL extract relevant technical information
5. WHEN file reading fails or README doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information
6. WHEN README contains HTML tags or complex formatting THEN the system SHALL extract plain text content for analysis

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser to return structured, consistent output, so that other components can reliably consume the extracted information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a standardized JSON object with defined schema
2. WHEN certain information categories are missing THEN the system SHALL include empty arrays/objects for those categories
3. WHEN parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL return error information alongside any successfully parsed data
4. WHEN confidence levels can be determined THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores for extracted information
5. WHEN multiple possible interpretations exist THEN the system SHALL provide the most likely interpretation with alternatives if applicable
