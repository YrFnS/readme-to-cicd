# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the three most critical system-level issues that are currently blocking the README-to-CICD system from functioning properly. Based on the comprehensive application status report, these issues must be resolved immediately to restore system stability and enable continued development. The three critical issues are: missing CLI method exports that prevent CLI functionality, a specific integration test failure in component initialization, and memory management issues causing test suite crashes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the CLI tool, I want all CLI methods to be properly exported and accessible, so that I can use the complete CLI functionality without encountering "method not found" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI module is imported THEN all required methods SHALL be properly exported from the index file
2. WHEN `writeWorkflowFiles` method is called THEN it SHALL execute successfully and write workflow files to the specified directory
3. WHEN `updateOptions` method is called THEN it SHALL update CLI configuration options and persist changes
4. WHEN `validateOutputDirectory` method is called THEN it SHALL validate the target directory and return appropriate validation results
5. WHEN CLI integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL pass without "method not found" errors
6. IF any CLI method is missing from exports THEN the build process SHALL fail with clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the integration test for component initialization to pass consistently, so that I can verify the system components are properly initialized and registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component initialization integration test runs THEN it SHALL successfully register all expected analyzers
2. WHEN `MockAnalyzer` is registered during testing THEN it SHALL appear in the analyzer list as expected
3. WHEN custom analyzer registration is tested THEN the registration process SHALL complete without errors
4. WHEN analyzer list is retrieved after registration THEN it SHALL contain all registered analyzers including custom ones
5. IF analyzer registration fails THEN the test SHALL provide detailed error information about the failure cause
6. WHEN the integration test completes THEN it SHALL clean up all test resources properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer running the test suite, I want tests to execute without memory crashes, so that I can reliably validate system functionality and identify actual test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite is executed THEN it SHALL complete without JavaScript heap out of memory errors
2. WHEN individual test files are run THEN they SHALL properly clean up memory resources after completion
3. WHEN test mocks and fixtures are created THEN they SHALL be properly disposed of in test teardown
4. WHEN large test datasets are processed THEN memory usage SHALL remain within acceptable limits
5. IF memory usage approaches limits THEN tests SHALL implement proper cleanup and garbage collection
6. WHEN test suite completes THEN overall memory usage SHALL return to baseline levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation that these critical fixes resolve the blocking issues, so that I can confirm the system is ready for continued development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all critical fixes are implemented THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL complete with zero errors
2. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the failure rate SHALL be reduced to less than 5%
3. WHEN CLI functionality is tested THEN all exported methods SHALL be accessible and functional
4. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the component initialization test SHALL pass consistently
5. WHEN memory monitoring is performed during tests THEN no memory crashes SHALL occur
6. WHEN system validation is complete THEN a comprehensive validation report SHALL confirm all critical issues are resolved
