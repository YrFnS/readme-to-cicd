# VS Code Extension Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VS Code Extension component provides integrated development environment support for the readme-to-cicd system, allowing developers to generate GitHub Actions workflows directly from within Visual Studio Code. It offers a graphical interface, real-time preview capabilities, and seamless integration with the existing CLI components. The extension enhances developer productivity by providing contextual assistance, visual feedback, and streamlined workflow management within the familiar VS Code environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate CI/CD workflows from my README file using VS Code commands, so that I can create automated pipelines without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a project with a README.md file THEN the extension SHALL detect it and show workflow generation options
2. WHEN I use the Command Palette THEN the extension SHALL provide "Generate CI/CD Workflow" commands
3. WHEN I right-click on README.md THEN the extension SHALL show context menu options for workflow generation
4. WHEN workflow generation completes THEN the extension SHALL open the generated workflow files in the editor
5. WHEN generation fails THEN the extension SHALL display clear error messages with actionable suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a visual interface for configuring workflow generation options, so that I can customize the CI/CD pipeline without memorizing command-line arguments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger workflow generation THEN the extension SHALL show a configuration panel with available options
2. WHEN I select framework options THEN the extension SHALL provide checkboxes and dropdowns for easy selection
3. WHEN I configure deployment settings THEN the extension SHALL show platform-specific configuration options
4. WHEN I modify settings THEN the extension SHALL provide real-time validation and feedback
5. WHEN I save configuration THEN the extension SHALL persist settings for future use

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview generated workflows before creating files, so that I can review and modify the CI/CD configuration before committing to it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate workflows THEN the extension SHALL show a preview panel with the generated YAML content
2. WHEN I view the preview THEN the extension SHALL provide syntax highlighting and formatting for YAML files
3. WHEN I make configuration changes THEN the extension SHALL update the preview in real-time
4. WHEN I approve the preview THEN the extension SHALL create the actual workflow files
5. WHEN I want to modify the preview THEN the extension SHALL allow inline editing before file creation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate with VS Code's file explorer and editor features, so that I can manage workflows alongside my project files seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow files are generated THEN the extension SHALL show them in the file explorer with appropriate icons
2. WHEN I open workflow files THEN the extension SHALL provide enhanced editing support with IntelliSense
3. WHEN I modify workflow files THEN the extension SHALL offer validation and error highlighting
4. WHEN I save workflow changes THEN the extension SHALL validate the YAML syntax and GitHub Actions schema
5. WHEN workflow files have issues THEN the extension SHALL show problems in the Problems panel

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to provide contextual help and documentation, so that I can understand workflow options and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over workflow configuration options THEN the extension SHALL show helpful tooltips and descriptions
2. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the extension SHALL provide detailed explanations and suggested fixes
3. WHEN I need help THEN the extension SHALL offer links to relevant documentation and examples
4. WHEN I use unfamiliar GitHub Actions THEN the extension SHALL provide action descriptions and parameter information
5. WHEN I want to learn more THEN the extension SHALL integrate with VS Code's help system and external resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to support workspace-level configuration, so that I can maintain consistent settings across team members and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure extension settings THEN the extension SHALL support both user and workspace-level preferences
2. WHEN I work in a team THEN the extension SHALL allow sharing configuration through workspace settings
3. WHEN I have organization policies THEN the extension SHALL enforce them in workflow generation
4. WHEN I switch projects THEN the extension SHALL load project-specific configuration automatically
5. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the extension SHALL provide clear resolution options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate with Git and source control features, so that I can track workflow changes and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate workflows THEN the extension SHALL detect Git repository status and offer to stage changes
2. WHEN workflow files are modified THEN the extension SHALL show changes in the Source Control panel
3. WHEN I commit changes THEN the extension SHALL suggest appropriate commit messages for workflow updates
4. WHEN I work with branches THEN the extension SHALL handle workflow generation across different branches
5. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the extension SHALL integrate with VS Code's merge conflict resolution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to provide workflow validation and testing capabilities, so that I can ensure my CI/CD pipelines work correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create workflows THEN the extension SHALL validate YAML syntax and GitHub Actions schema
2. WHEN I use GitHub Actions THEN the extension SHALL check for action availability and version compatibility
3. WHEN I configure secrets THEN the extension SHALL validate secret references and suggest proper usage
4. WHEN I want to test workflows THEN the extension SHALL provide dry-run capabilities and simulation
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the extension SHALL highlight issues and provide fix suggestions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to support multiple workflow types and templates, so that I can generate different pipelines for various project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select workflow types THEN the extension SHALL offer CI, CD, release, and maintenance workflow options
2. WHEN I choose templates THEN the extension SHALL provide framework-specific and organization templates
3. WHEN I need custom workflows THEN the extension SHALL support template customization and creation
4. WHEN I work with complex projects THEN the extension SHALL handle multi-workflow generation and coordination
5. WHEN I update workflows THEN the extension SHALL preserve custom modifications while updating generated sections

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to provide performance monitoring and optimization suggestions, so that I can create efficient CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate workflows THEN the extension SHALL analyze and suggest performance optimizations
2. WHEN I configure caching THEN the extension SHALL recommend appropriate caching strategies for detected frameworks
3. WHEN I set up matrix builds THEN the extension SHALL suggest optimal matrix configurations
4. WHEN I use parallel jobs THEN the extension SHALL analyze dependencies and recommend job ordering
