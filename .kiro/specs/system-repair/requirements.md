# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical system-wide issues identified in the comprehensive application status report that are preventing the README-to-CICD system from functioning. The system is currently in a BROKEN STATE with a health score of 42/100, featuring TypeScript compilation failures, 22.3% test failure rate, and 2,986 code quality issues. These critical blocking issues must be resolved systematically to restore the system to a development-ready state before any feature development can proceed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed completely, so that I can build and run the application without blocking errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation is executed THEN it SHALL complete with zero errors
2. WHEN the central logger module is missing THEN it SHALL be created at `src/shared/logging/central-logger.ts`
3. WHEN logger dependencies are imported THEN they SHALL resolve to valid module paths
4. WHEN all source files are compiled THEN they SHALL pass strict TypeScript checking
5. IF any compilation errors remain THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved systematically
6. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN the build process SHALL generate valid JavaScript output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing CLI dependencies installed, so that the command-line interface can function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLI dependencies are checked THEN cosmiconfig, commander, inquirer, and ora SHALL be installed
2. WHEN package.json is updated THEN it SHALL include all required CLI dependencies with appropriate versions
3. WHEN CLI modules are imported THEN they SHALL resolve without module not found errors
4. WHEN npm install is executed THEN it SHALL complete successfully without dependency conflicts
5. IF any dependency installation fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the integration pipeline properly connected, so that components can communicate and share data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ReadmeParserImpl is instantiated THEN it SHALL use the IntegrationPipeline for component coordination
2. WHEN command extraction occurs THEN commands SHALL inherit language context from LanguageDetector
3. WHEN multiple analyzers run THEN they SHALL share data through the integration pipeline
4. WHEN analyzer results are aggregated THEN they SHALL maintain proper context and relationships
5. IF integration pipeline fails THEN it SHALL provide detailed error information and fallback behavior
6. WHEN end-to-end parsing workflow executes THEN it SHALL process README files with proper component integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want test failure rate reduced to acceptable levels, so that the system reliability can be validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the failure rate SHALL be less than 5%
2. WHEN critical test failures are identified THEN they SHALL be prioritized and resolved systematically
3. WHEN template fallback system is tested THEN it SHALL handle caching and priority selection correctly
4. WHEN enhanced validation security analysis runs THEN it SHALL detect secret exposure and vulnerabilities
5. WHEN VSCode extension tests execute THEN they SHALL have proper API mocking and webview support
6. IF test failures persist THEN they SHALL be categorized and addressed based on criticality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a code maintainer, I want critical code quality issues resolved, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint analysis runs THEN it SHALL report fewer than 100 total issues
2. WHEN unused variables and parameters are detected THEN they SHALL be removed or marked as intentionally unused
3. WHEN console.log statements are found in production code THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper logging
4. WHEN unreachable code is identified THEN it SHALL be removed or made reachable
5. WHEN missing type definitions are detected THEN they SHALL be added with appropriate TypeScript types
6. IF code quality issues remain THEN they SHALL be prioritized based on impact and maintainability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive system validation, so that I can confirm the system is ready for continued development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system validation runs THEN it SHALL verify all critical components are functional
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL confirm proper data flow between components
3. WHEN performance benchmarks are measured THEN they SHALL meet acceptable thresholds
4. WHEN security validation runs THEN it SHALL identify no critical vulnerabilities
5. WHEN end-to-end workflows are tested THEN they SHALL complete successfully from README input to YAML output
6. IF any validation fails THEN it SHALL provide actionable recommendations for resolution
