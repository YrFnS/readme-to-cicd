# Framework Detection Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Framework Detection component analyzes project information extracted from README files and file system structure to identify specific frameworks, build tools, and development environments. It provides intelligent suggestions for CI/CD pipeline steps based on detected frameworks and project patterns. This component works in conjunction with the README Parser to provide comprehensive project analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect Node.js projects and their specific frameworks, so that appropriate CI/CD workflows can be generated with correct setup and build steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json file is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a Node.js project
2. WHEN npm scripts are present in package.json THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize build, test, and start scripts
3. WHEN popular Node.js frameworks are detected (React, Vue, Angular, Express, Next.js, etc.) THEN the system SHALL identify the specific framework and version
4. WHEN Node.js project is confirmed THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate CI steps including Node version setup, dependency installation, and script execution
5. IF package-lock.json or yarn.lock exists THEN the system SHALL recommend using the corresponding package manager

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect Python projects and their frameworks, so that CI/CD pipelines include proper Python environment setup and dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements.txt, setup.py, Pipfile, or pyproject.toml is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a Python project
2. WHEN Python frameworks are identified (Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.) THEN the system SHALL detect the specific framework and suggest appropriate CI steps
3. WHEN virtual environment indicators are present THEN the system SHALL recommend virtual environment setup in CI
4. WHEN Python version is specified in configuration files THEN the system SHALL extract and use the specified version
5. WHEN testing frameworks (pytest, unittest, nose) are detected THEN the system SHALL include appropriate test execution steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect Rust projects and their build configuration, so that CI/CD workflows include proper Rust toolchain setup and cargo commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Cargo.toml file is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a Rust project
2. WHEN Rust edition and dependencies are specified in Cargo.toml THEN the system SHALL extract this information
3. WHEN workspace configuration is present THEN the system SHALL detect multi-crate project structure
4. WHEN Rust project is confirmed THEN the system SHALL suggest CI steps including Rust toolchain installation, cargo build, and cargo test
5. IF Cargo.lock exists THEN the system SHALL recommend including it in CI for reproducible builds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect Go projects and their module structure, so that CI/CD pipelines use appropriate Go tooling and build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN go.mod file is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a Go project
2. WHEN Go version is specified in go.mod THEN the system SHALL extract and use the specified version
3. WHEN Go modules and dependencies are present THEN the system SHALL analyze the module structure
4. WHEN Go project is confirmed THEN the system SHALL suggest CI steps including Go installation, module download, build, and test commands
5. WHEN build constraints or tags are detected THEN the system SHALL include appropriate build flags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect Java/JVM projects and their build tools, so that CI/CD workflows use the correct build system and Java version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pom.xml, build.gradle, or build.gradle.kts is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a Java/JVM project
2. WHEN Maven is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest Maven-specific CI steps (mvn clean compile test)
3. WHEN Gradle is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest Gradle-specific CI steps (./gradlew build test)
4. WHEN Java version is specified in build files THEN the system SHALL extract and use the specified version
5. WHEN additional JVM languages (Kotlin, Scala) are detected THEN the system SHALL include language-specific considerations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect containerized projects, so that CI/CD workflows include Docker build and deployment steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dockerfile is detected THEN the system SHALL identify containerization requirements
2. WHEN docker-compose.yml is present THEN the system SHALL suggest multi-container setup steps
3. WHEN container registry references are found THEN the system SHALL include image push/pull steps
4. WHEN Kubernetes manifests are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest deployment pipeline steps
5. WHEN container project is confirmed THEN the system SHALL recommend Docker build, test, and security scanning steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect web frontend projects and their build tools, so that CI/CD workflows include appropriate bundling and deployment steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend build tools (webpack, vite, parcel, rollup) are detected THEN the system SHALL identify the build system
2. WHEN static site generators (Gatsby, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Jekyll) are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate build and deployment steps
3. WHEN package.json contains frontend-specific scripts THEN the system SHALL categorize and prioritize build steps
4. WHEN frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) are detected THEN the system SHALL include framework-specific optimizations
5. WHEN deployment targets (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) are mentioned THEN the system SHALL suggest platform-specific deployment steps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide confidence scores and alternative suggestions, so that I can understand the reliability of framework detection and choose appropriate options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework detection completes THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for each detected framework
2. WHEN multiple possible frameworks are detected THEN the system SHALL rank them by confidence and evidence
3. WHEN detection is uncertain THEN the system SHALL provide alternative framework suggestions
4. WHEN conflicting evidence exists THEN the system SHALL report the conflict and suggest manual verification
5. WHEN no clear framework is detected THEN the system SHALL provide generic CI suggestions based on detected languages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to suggest comprehensive CI/CD pipeline steps, so that generated workflows include all necessary setup, build, test, and deployment phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework is detected THEN the system SHALL generate ordered CI steps including environment setup, dependency installation, build, test, and deployment
2. WHEN security scanning tools are appropriate THEN the system SHALL include security analysis steps
3. WHEN performance testing is relevant THEN the system SHALL suggest performance benchmarking steps
4. WHEN multiple environments are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest environment-specific deployment steps
5. WHEN caching opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate caching strategies

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle complex multi-language and multi-framework projects, so that CI/CD workflows accommodate all project components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL coordinate framework detection across languages
2. WHEN monorepo structure is identified THEN the system SHALL suggest workspace-aware CI strategies
3. WHEN microservices architecture is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend service-specific build and deployment steps
4. WHEN frontend and backend components coexist THEN the system SHALL coordinate build order and dependencies
5. WHEN conflicting framework requirements exist THEN the system SHALL provide resolution strategies and warnings
