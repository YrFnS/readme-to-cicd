# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining TypeScript compilation errors that are blocking the integration-deployment phase. Currently, there are 2 critical TypeScript errors in the orchestration engine: a missing Result type import and an incorrect method name reference. These errors must be resolved to enable successful compilation and allow the integration-deployment spec to proceed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the orchestration engine, I want the Result type to be properly imported and available, so that the orchestration engine can compile without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestration engine imports the Result type THEN it SHALL find a valid type definition
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN it SHALL not produce errors related to missing Result type
3. WHEN the Result type is used in function signatures THEN it SHALL provide proper type safety
4. IF the Result type doesn't exist THEN it SHALL be created with appropriate generic type parameters
5. WHEN the Result type is imported THEN it SHALL be imported from the correct shared types location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the YAML generator, I want the orchestration engine to call the correct method name, so that YAML generation works without method name errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestration engine calls YAML generator methods THEN it SHALL use the correct method names
2. WHEN generateWorkflow method is called THEN it SHALL be called with proper parameters and return types
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN it SHALL not produce errors related to incorrect method names
4. IF multiple workflows need to be generated THEN the orchestration engine SHALL handle single workflow generation appropriately
5. WHEN method signatures are validated THEN they SHALL match between caller and implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed completely, so that the codebase is ready for integration-deployment phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation is executed THEN it SHALL complete with zero errors
2. WHEN all source files are compiled THEN they SHALL pass strict TypeScript checking
3. WHEN compilation validation runs THEN it SHALL confirm successful build status
4. IF any compilation errors remain THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved systematically
5. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN the integration-deployment phase SHALL be unblocked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive validation of the error fixes, so that I can confirm the system is ready for final integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error fixes are implemented THEN they SHALL be validated with unit tests
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL pass with the corrected code
3. WHEN the orchestration engine is tested THEN it SHALL function correctly with proper types and method calls
4. IF any regressions are introduced THEN they SHALL be detected and prevented
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN it SHALL generate a clean compilation report
