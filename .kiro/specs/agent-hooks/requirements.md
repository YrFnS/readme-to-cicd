# Agent Hooks Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Hooks component provides automated integration capabilities that extend the readme-to-cicd system with intelligent automation features. It monitors repository changes, automatically creates pull requests with performance benchmarks, and provides continuous optimization suggestions. The component integrates with GitHub's API and webhook system to provide seamless automation that enhances the CI/CD pipeline with proactive monitoring and improvement suggestions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect when my README or project structure changes, so that CI/CD workflows can be updated without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README.md file is modified THEN the system SHALL detect changes and trigger workflow analysis
2. WHEN project dependencies change THEN the system SHALL detect framework updates and suggest workflow improvements
3. WHEN new files are added that indicate framework changes THEN the system SHALL automatically re-analyze the project
4. WHEN configuration files are modified THEN the system SHALL validate and update corresponding workflow steps
5. WHEN changes are detected THEN the system SHALL queue analysis tasks without blocking repository operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically create pull requests with updated workflows, so that I can review and approve CI/CD changes through my normal code review process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow updates are generated THEN the system SHALL create a pull request with the updated workflow files
2. WHEN creating PRs THEN the system SHALL include detailed descriptions of changes and rationale
3. WHEN multiple changes are detected THEN the system SHALL batch related updates into single pull requests
4. WHEN PR creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and error notifications
5. WHEN PRs are created THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate reviewers based on repository configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to include performance benchmarks in pull requests, so that I can understand the impact of workflow changes on build times and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating workflow PRs THEN the system SHALL include performance impact analysis
2. WHEN benchmarks are available THEN the system SHALL compare new workflows against current performance baselines
3. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight potential issues and suggest optimizations
4. WHEN improvements are identified THEN the system SHALL quantify expected performance gains
5. WHEN historical data exists THEN the system SHALL provide trend analysis and performance evolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to monitor CI/CD pipeline performance continuously, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics and execution data
2. WHEN performance patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL analyze trends and detect anomalies
3. WHEN bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific optimization strategies
4. WHEN resource usage is inefficient THEN the system SHALL recommend caching and parallelization improvements
5. WHEN monitoring data accumulates THEN the system SHALL provide performance dashboards and reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with GitHub's webhook system, so that automation can respond to repository events in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository events occur THEN the system SHALL receive webhook notifications and process them appropriately
2. WHEN push events are received THEN the system SHALL analyze changed files and trigger relevant automation
3. WHEN pull requests are opened THEN the system SHALL validate workflow changes and provide feedback
4. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL analyze release workflows and suggest improvements
5. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide intelligent suggestions for workflow improvements, so that my CI/CD pipelines can evolve and optimize over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing workflows THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for performance improvements
2. WHEN new GitHub Actions are available THEN the system SHALL suggest upgrades and feature adoption
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend security enhancements
4. WHEN best practices evolve THEN the system SHALL suggest workflow modernization
5. WHEN suggestions are made THEN the system SHALL provide implementation guidance and impact assessment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support custom automation rules and triggers, so that I can tailor the automation behavior to my team's specific needs and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring automation THEN the system SHALL support custom trigger conditions and rules
2. WHEN defining rules THEN the system SHALL provide flexible condition matching and action specification
3. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution and priority management
4. WHEN custom actions are needed THEN the system SHALL support extensible action plugins
5. WHEN rules are updated THEN the system SHALL validate configuration and provide feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with project management tools, so that workflow improvements can be tracked and prioritized alongside other development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow issues are identified THEN the system SHALL create tickets in configured project management systems
2. WHEN creating tickets THEN the system SHALL include detailed descriptions, priority levels, and implementation guidance
3. WHEN tickets are resolved THEN the system SHALL track implementation status and validate fixes
4. WHEN integration is configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple project management platforms
5. WHEN ticket creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative notification methods

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide security scanning and compliance monitoring, so that CI/CD workflows maintain security standards and regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are analyzed THEN the system SHALL scan for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
2. WHEN security problems are detected THEN the system SHALL create high-priority alerts and remediation suggestions
3. WHEN compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL update workflows to maintain compliance
4. WHEN security updates are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize and recommend security-related improvements
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of security-related changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support team collaboration and approval workflows, so that automated changes can be reviewed and approved according to team policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL route them through configured approval workflows
2. WHEN approvals are required THEN the system SHALL notify appropriate team members and track approval status
3. WHEN changes are approved THEN the system SHALL automatically implement the approved modifications
4. WHEN approvals are denied THEN the system SHALL provide feedback mechanisms and alternative suggestions
5. WHEN approval policies change THEN the system SHALL adapt automation behavior to match new requirements
