# YAML Generator Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YAML Generator component creates GitHub Actions workflow files based on framework detection results and CI pipeline configurations. It transforms the structured CI steps and framework information into properly formatted YAML files that can be directly used in GitHub repositories. This component serves as the final output stage of the automated CI/CD pipeline generation process.
