# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical MockAnalyzer registration failure that is blocking integration tests and preventing the system from validating custom analyzer functionality. The failing test "should register custom analyzers when provided" shows that MockAnalyzer is not being included in the analyzer list, indicating a broken plugin registration system. This issue must be resolved to ensure the integration pipeline can properly register and utilize custom analyzers for testing and extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests, I want MockAnalyzer to be properly registered when provided, so that custom analyzer functionality can be validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MockAnalyzer is provided to the component factory THEN it SHALL be included in the analyzer list
2. WHEN the analyzer list is retrieved THEN it SHALL contain 'MockAnalyzer' as one of the registered analyzers
3. WHEN custom analyzers are registered THEN they SHALL be accessible through the same interface as built-in analyzers
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL successfully validate custom analyzer registration
5. IF MockAnalyzer registration fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the analyzer registration system to work consistently, so that both built-in and custom analyzers can be registered reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzers are registered THEN the registration system SHALL handle both built-in and custom analyzers uniformly
2. WHEN multiple custom analyzers are provided THEN they SHALL all be registered successfully
3. WHEN analyzer registration occurs THEN it SHALL validate analyzer interfaces before registration
4. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL register all provided analyzers in the correct order
5. IF analyzer registration fails THEN it SHALL not affect the registration of other analyzers
6. WHEN analyzers are queried THEN the system SHALL return all successfully registered analyzers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of analyzer registration, so that I can verify the plugin system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzer registration tests run THEN they SHALL verify all registered analyzers are accessible
2. WHEN custom analyzer functionality is tested THEN it SHALL execute through the same pipeline as built-in analyzers
3. WHEN analyzer registration is validated THEN it SHALL confirm proper interface implementation
4. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL pass with 100% success rate for analyzer registration
5. IF any analyzer registration test fails THEN it SHALL provide detailed diagnostics about the failure
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN it SHALL generate a report confirming analyzer registration status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system, I want clear documentation and examples of custom analyzer registration, so that I can implement and test custom analyzers effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom analyzer registration is documented THEN it SHALL provide clear implementation examples
2. WHEN analyzer interface requirements are specified THEN they SHALL be comprehensive and accurate
3. WHEN registration process is explained THEN it SHALL include step-by-step instructions
4. WHEN troubleshooting information is provided THEN it SHALL address common registration failures
5. IF registration documentation is incomplete THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect actual working implementation
6. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL be tested and verified to work correctly
