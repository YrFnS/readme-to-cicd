# CLI Tool Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CLI Tool component provides a command-line interface for the readme-to-cicd system, allowing developers to generate GitHub Actions workflows from README files through terminal commands. It integrates the README Parser, Framework Detection, and YAML Generator components into a cohesive, user-friendly tool that can be used locally or in CI/CD environments. The CLI supports various output formats, configuration options, and interactive modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a simple command to generate CI/CD workflows from my README file, so that I can quickly set up automated pipelines without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the CLI with a README file path THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate GitHub Actions workflow files
2. WHEN I run the CLI without arguments THEN the system SHALL automatically detect README.md in the current directory
3. WHEN workflow generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL output the generated files to .github/workflows/ directory
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable suggestions
5. WHEN I use the --help flag THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage information and examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the CLI behavior through command-line options, so that I can control the generation process according to my project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify --output-dir THEN the system SHALL generate workflows in the specified directory
2. WHEN I use --workflow-type THEN the system SHALL generate only the specified workflow type (ci, cd, release)
3. WHEN I specify --framework THEN the system SHALL override automatic framework detection
4. WHEN I use --dry-run THEN the system SHALL show what would be generated without creating files
5. WHEN I specify --config THEN the system SHALL load configuration from the specified file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to provide verbose output and debugging information, so that I can understand what the tool is doing and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use --verbose flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed processing information
2. WHEN I use --debug flag THEN the system SHALL show internal processing steps and detection results
3. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for long-running operations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information with stack traces in debug mode
5. WHEN I use --quiet flag THEN the system SHALL suppress all non-essential output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to support interactive mode, so that I can make choices about framework detection and workflow generation through prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use --interactive flag THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation of detected frameworks
2. WHEN multiple frameworks are detected THEN the system SHALL allow me to select which ones to include
3. WHEN workflow conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution choices
4. WHEN deployment options are available THEN the system SHALL ask for deployment target preferences
5. WHEN interactive mode is used THEN the system SHALL save choices for future runs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to validate existing workflows and suggest improvements, so that I can optimize my current CI/CD setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use --validate flag with existing workflows THEN the system SHALL check for syntax and best practice issues
2. WHEN validation finds issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific suggestions for improvement
3. WHEN I use --update flag THEN the system SHALL modify existing workflows to incorporate improvements
4. WHEN workflows are outdated THEN the system SHALL suggest newer action versions and patterns
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of findings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to support configuration files, so that I can maintain consistent settings across projects and team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .readme-to-cicd.json config file exists THEN the system SHALL automatically load configuration
2. WHEN I specify custom templates in config THEN the system SHALL use them instead of defaults
3. WHEN organization policies are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce them in generated workflows
4. WHEN I use --init flag THEN the system SHALL create a sample configuration file
5. WHEN config validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about invalid settings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to integrate with version control systems, so that I can track changes and collaborate effectively on workflow configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating workflows THEN the system SHALL detect if the project is in a Git repository
2. WHEN Git is detected THEN the system SHALL offer to commit generated workflows automatically
3. WHEN I use --git-commit flag THEN the system SHALL create commits with descriptive messages
4. WHEN workflows are updated THEN the system SHALL show diffs of changes made
5. WHEN branch protection exists THEN the system SHALL warn about potential conflicts with generated workflows

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to support batch processing, so that I can generate workflows for multiple projects or repositories efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify multiple directories THEN the system SHALL process each project independently
2. WHEN I use --recursive flag THEN the system SHALL find and process all projects in subdirectories
3. WHEN batch processing occurs THEN the system SHALL provide summary reports for all processed projects
4. WHEN some projects fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing others and report failures at the end
5. WHEN I use --parallel flag THEN the system SHALL process multiple projects concurrently

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to provide export and import capabilities, so that I can share configurations and workflows between projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use --export flag THEN the system SHALL create a portable configuration package
2. WHEN I use --import flag THEN the system SHALL apply configurations from an exported package
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include custom templates and organization policies
4. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with the target project
5. WHEN conflicts exist during import THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution strategies

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to integrate with CI/CD environments, so that I can use it in automated workflows and deployment pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in CI environment THEN the system SHALL automatically use non-interactive mode
2. WHEN CI environment variables are present THEN the system SHALL use them for configuration
3. WHEN I use --ci flag THEN the system SHALL optimize output for CI/CD consumption
4. WHEN running in CI THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable output formats (JSON, XML)
5. WHEN CI integration is used THEN the system SHALL support exit codes for success/failure detection
