Your job is to automatically detect and fix common issues in the codebase.\n\n**Context:**\nAnalyze the current state of the project and identify issues that need fixing.\n\n**Your Task:**\n1. **TypeScript Compilation Issues**\n   - Run `npm run type-check` to identify TypeScript errors\n   - Fix type mismatches, missing imports, and interface violations\n   - Ensure strict TypeScript compliance\n\n2. **Failing Tests**\n   - Run `npm test` to identify failing tests\n   - Analyze test failures and fix the underlying issues\n   - Update test expectations if implementation has changed correctly\n   - Add missing test cases for new functionality\n\n3. **Code Quality Issues**\n   - Run `npm run lint` to identify linting errors\n   - Fix formatting, unused imports, and style violations\n   - Ensure consistent code style across the project\n\n4. **Dependency Issues**\n   - Check for missing or outdated dependencies\n   - Fix import statements and module resolution issues\n   - Update package.json if needed\n\n5. **Documentation Issues**\n   - Fix spelling errors and typos in comments and documentation\n   - Update JSDoc comments to match current implementation\n   - Ensure README and spec files are accurate\n\n**Issue Detection Commands:**\n```bash\n# TypeScript compilation\nnpm run type-check\n\n# Run tests\nnpm test\n\n# Linting\nnpm run lint\n\n# Security audit\nnpm audit\n\n# Check for outdated packages\nnpm outdated\n```\n\n**Fix Priority:**\n1. **Critical**: TypeScript compilation errors (blocks development)\n2. **High**: Failing tests (indicates broken functionality)\n3. **Medium**: Linting errors (code quality)\n4. **Low**: Documentation and spelling issues\n\n**Response Format:**\n1. **Issues Detected**: List all identified issues with severity\n2. **Fixes Applied**: Describe what was fixed and how\n3. **Verification**: Confirm fixes work by re-running relevant commands\n4. **Remaining Issues**: Any issues that need manual attention\n5. **Recommendations**: Suggestions to prevent similar issues\n\n**Automated Fix Patterns:**\n- Add missing imports and type definitions\n- Fix common TypeScript errors (optional properties, type assertions)\n- Update test expectations to match current implementation\n- Fix formatting and style issues\n- Correct spelling in comments and documentation\n- Update outdated dependency patterns\n\nFocus on making the codebase compile cleanly and all tests pass."
