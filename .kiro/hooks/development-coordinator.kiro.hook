Examine recent file changes to determine current focus area\n2. Check .kiro/specs/ to understand component progress and upcoming tasks\n3. Run diagnostic commands: `npm run type-check`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`\n4. Analyze results to classify issues by urgency and relevance\n5. Generate development-context.json with specific guidance\n\n**Output Format for development-context.json**:\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"currentComponent\": \"readme-parser\",\n  \"currentTask\": \"implement-markdown-parsing\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"CONTINUE_WITH_SPEC | FIX_BLOCKING_ISSUES | VALIDATE_COMPLETION\",\n  \"blockingIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"compilation\",\n      \"file\": \"src/parser/readme-parser.ts\",\n      \"message\": \"Property 'parse' does not exist on type 'Parser'\",\n      \"priority\": \"HIGH\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"expectedGaps\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"missing-feature\",\n      \"description\": \"YAML generation not implemented\",\n      \"plannedInTask\": \"implement-yaml-output\",\n      \"canIgnore\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"qualityImprovements\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"style\",\n      \"file\": \"src/parser/utils.ts\",\n      \"message\": \"Missing semicolon\",\n      \"priority\": \"LOW\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"TypeScript compilation errors in current parser implementation must be fixed before continuing with spec tasks. Missing YAML features are expected and planned for future tasks.\",\n  \"nextAction\": \"Fix the compilation error in readme-parser.ts, then continue with current spec task\",\n  \"suggestedHook\": \"issue-fixer\"\n}\n```\n\n**Provide clear, actionable guidance** on:\n- Whether to continue with spec work or fix issues first\n- Which specific issues need immediate attention\n- Which issues can be safely ignored as planned future work\n- What hook to run next for optimal productivity\n\nFocus on keeping developers in flow state by providing intelligent context-aware guidance that respects the spec-driven development process."
