# Automatic Garbage Collection Triggers Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of automatic garbage collection triggers for the README-to-CICD system, addressing task 17 from the production readiness specification. The implementation provides automatic memory management during test execution to prevent memory exhaustion and improve test suite stability.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components

#### 1. AutomaticGCTriggers Class (`src/shared/automatic-gc-triggers.ts`)

The main class that manages automatic garbage collection triggers based on various conditions:

- **Test Count Triggers**: Automatically triggers GC after a specified number of tests
- **Memory Threshold Triggers**: Monitors memory usage and triggers GC when thresholds are exceeded
- **Suite Boundary Triggers**: Triggers GC between test suites to prevent memory accumulation
- **Failed Test Cleanup**: Triggers GC after failed tests when memory usage is high
- **Manual Triggers**: Provides manual GC triggering capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Configurable trigger conditions and thresholds
- Multiple GC passes for better effectiveness
- Memory usage measurement and effectiveness scoring
- Comprehensive statistics and reporting
- Error handling and graceful degradation

#### 2. Test Setup Integration (`tests/setup/automatic-gc-setup.ts`)

Integrates automatic GC triggers into the Vitest test environment:

- Initializes GC triggers with environment-specific configuration
- Hooks into Vitest lifecycle events (beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, afterEach)
- Provides utility functions for tests to interact with GC system
- Generates comprehensive reports at test completion

#### 3. Configuration Integration (`vitest.config.ts`)

Updated Vitest configuration to include the automatic GC setup:

```typescript
setupFiles: [
  // ... existing setup files
  './tests/setup/automatic-gc-setup.ts'
]
```

### Configuration Options

The system supports extensive configuration through environment variables and programmatic settings:

```typescript
interface GCTriggerConfig {
  enabled: boolean;                    // Enable/disable GC triggers
  triggerAfterTests: number;          // Trigger after N tests (default: 15)
  memoryThresholdMB: number;          // Memory threshold in MB (default: 400)
  triggerBetweenSuites: boolean;      // Trigger between suites (default: true)
  gcPasses: number;                   // Number of GC passes (default: 2)
  gcPassDelay: number;                // Delay between passes in ms (default: 10)
  enableLogging: boolean;             // Enable detailed logging
  forceGCForTesting: boolean;         // Force GC even without --expose-gc
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `GC_TRIGGER_AFTER_TESTS`: Number of tests after which to trigger GC
- `GC_MEMORY_THRESHOLD_MB`: Memory threshold in MB
- `GC_TRIGGER_BETWEEN_SUITES`: Enable/disable suite boundary triggers
- `GC_PASSES`: Number of GC passes per trigger
- `GC_PASS_DELAY`: Delay between GC passes
- `GC_DEBUG`: Enable detailed logging
- `FORCE_GC_FOR_TESTING`: Force GC for testing without --expose-gc

## Test Coverage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

The system is automatically enabled when the test setup is loaded. No additional configuration is required for basic usage.

### Manual GC Triggering

```typescript
import { manualGCTrigger } from '../setup/automatic-gc-setup.js';

// Manually trigger GC
manualGCTrigger('before_memory_intensive_operation');
```

### Memory-Intensive Operations

```typescript
import { withGCProtection } from '../setup/automatic-gc-setup.js';

// Protect memory-intensive operations
const result = await withGCProtection(async () => {
  // Memory-intensive operation
  const largeData = createLargeDataStructure();
  return processData(largeData);
}, 'data_processing');
```

### Configuration Updates

```typescript
import { updateGCConfig } from '../setup/automatic-gc-setup.js';

// Update configuration at runtime
updateGCConfig({
  triggerAfterTests: 5,
  memoryThresholdMB: 200
});
```
