# Agent Hooks Integration

The Agent Hooks Integration component provides intelligent automation workflows that respond to repository events, optimize performance, manage dependencies, and implement recovery mechanisms. This component represents the cutting-edge of CI/CD automation, bringing AI-driven intelligence to workflow management.

## Overview

Agent Hooks Integration creates four specialized workflow types:

1. **Webhook Response Workflows** - Respond intelligently to repository events
2. **Dependency Update Workflows** - Automated, risk-assessed dependency management
3. **Performance Optimization Workflows** - Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
4. **Retry & Recovery Workflows** - Intelligent failure recovery and resilience patterns

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Intelligent Automation
- **Event-Driven Responses**: Automatically respond to README changes, performance regressions, security alerts
- **Risk Assessment**: Intelligent analysis of dependency updates with automated risk scoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of workflow performance with optimization suggestions
- **Failure Recovery**: Smart retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and pattern recognition

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

```typescript
interface AgentHooksConfig {
  webhookEvents: GitHubEvent[];
  automationLevel: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'aggressive';
  optimizationEnabled: boolean;
  recoveryEnabled: boolean;
  dependencyUpdateStrategy: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive';
  performanceThresholds: PerformanceThresholds;
}
```

### ðŸ“Š Performance Thresholds

```typescript
interface PerformanceThresholds {
  buildTimeMinutes: number;        // Trigger optimization if build exceeds this
  testTimeMinutes: number;         // Trigger optimization if tests exceed this
  deploymentTimeMinutes: number;   // Trigger optimization if deployment exceeds this
  failureRatePercent: number;      // Trigger recovery if failure rate exceeds this
  resourceUsagePercent: number;    // Trigger optimization if resource usage exceeds this
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { AgentHooksIntegration } from './workflow-specialization/agent-hooks-integration';

const agentHooks = new AgentHooksIntegration({
  automationLevel: 'standard',
  optimizationEnabled: true,
  recoveryEnabled: true
});

const workflows = await agentHooks.generateAgentHooksWorkflows(
  detectionResult,
  options
);
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
const agentHooks = new AgentHooksIntegration({
  automationLevel: 'aggressive',
  optimizationEnabled: true,
  recoveryEnabled: true,

    testTimeMinutes: 15,
    deploymentTimeMinutes: 20,
    failureRatePercent: 5,
    resourceUsagePercent: 80
  },
  webhookEvents: [
    { type: 'push', branches: ['main', 'develop'] },
    { type: 'pull_request', actions: ['opened', 'synchronize'] },
    { type: 'issues', actions: ['opened', 'labeled'] }
