1. README Parser
Start here - foundation with no dependencies
Provides structured data extraction from README files
Output format will define interfaces for downstream components

2. Framework Detection
Depends on README Parser output format
Uses parsed README data to identify technologies and frameworks
Critical for determining what type of CI/CD workflows to generate

3. YAML Generator
Complex but critical component
Depends on both README Parser and Framework Detection outputs
Start with basic templates, then enhance with advanced features
This completes your core data processing pipeline

4. CLI Tool
Ties everything together for the core workflow
Provides command-line interface to the complete pipeline
End-to-end functionality will be available after this step

5. VSCode Extension
Provides user experience but isn't critical for core functionality
Uses CLI Tool as its backend
Adds IDE integration for better developer experience

6. Agent Hooks
Adds intelligence and automation
Requires the core pipeline (steps 1-4) to be working
Provides GitHub integration and workflow optimization

7. Integration & Deployment
Implement last as it orchestrates everything
Handles production deployment and system-wide management
Depends on ALL other components being functional
