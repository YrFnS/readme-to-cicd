# Task 12: Comprehensive Error Handling and Alternative Suggestions - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive error handling, alternative suggestions, conflict resolution, warning systems, and structured logging for the framework detection system.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Custom Error Classes (`src/detection/errors/detection-errors.ts`)
- **DetectionError**: Base error class with structured information
- **ParseError**: For file parsing failures with line numbers
- **DetectionFailureError**: For framework detection failures
- **ConfigurationError**: For invalid configuration issues
- **FileSystemError**: For file system operation failures
- **ValidationError**: For input validation failures
- **IntegrationError**: For component integration failures
- **ResourceError**: For system resource exhaustion

**Features:**
- Structured error information with context
- Recoverable vs non-recoverable error classification
- Error codes for programmatic handling
- Conversion to structured log format

### 2. Error Recovery System (`src/detection/errors/error-recovery.ts`)
- **Result Pattern**: Type-safe error handling with `Result<T, E>`
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable attempts
- **Fallback Operations**: Graceful degradation strategies
- **Safe Execution**: Error containment with default values
- **Input Validation**: Type-safe validation with error results

**Features:**
- Configurable retry policies
- Automatic error classification
- Timeout and backoff management
- Error containment strategies

### 3. Alternative Suggestion Generator (`src/detection/utils/alternative-suggestions.ts`)
- **Low Confidence Alternatives**: Suggestions when detection confidence is low
- **Evidence-Based Suggestions**: Alternatives from unmatched evidence
- **Missing Framework Detection**: Common frameworks for detected languages
- **Language-Framework Matching**: Suggestions for mismatched combinations

**Features:**
- Framework pattern recognition
- Confidence-based suggestion generation
- Actionable recommendations
- Conflict detection with existing frameworks

### 4. Conflict Resolution System (`src/detection/utils/conflict-resolution.ts`)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies same framework detected multiple times
- **Incompatibility Checking**: Detects conflicting framework combinations
- **Version Conflicts**: Handles multiple versions of same framework
- **Build Tool Conflicts**: Resolves multiple package manager conflicts
- **Automatic Resolution**: Configurable resolution strategies

**Features:**
- Comprehensive conflict detection
- Automatic resolution where possible
- Manual review flagging for complex conflicts
- Detailed resolution explanations

### 5. Warning System (`src/detection/utils/warning-system.ts`)
- **Categorized Warnings**: Security, performance, configuration, etc.
- **Severity Levels**: Info, warning, error, critical
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for each warning
- **Filtering Capabilities**: By severity and category

**Warning Categories:**
- Detection quality issues
- Configuration problems
- Compatibility concerns
- Security implications
- Performance considerations
- Best practice violations
- Maintenance concerns

### 6. Structured Logging (`src/detection/utils/logger.ts`)
- **Correlation IDs**: Request tracking across components
- **Structured Format**: JSON logging with context
- **Secret Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Console and structured logging
- **Child Loggers**: Contextual logging with inheritance

**Features:**
- Configurable log levels
- Context preservation
- Performance timing utilities
- Safe object serialization
- Log entry filtering and export

## Integration Updates
