# QA Issues for README-to-CICD

## Functional Issues
- **Incomplete Detection** (Medium): The detection engine occasionally fails to identify all relevant CI/CD configurations within README files, leading to incomplete analysis reports. Affected: Detection Engine. Recommendation: Expand regex patterns and add machine learning-based detection for ambiguous cases.
- **Hanging Commands** (High): CLI commands can hang indefinitely when processing large files without providing user feedback or error messages. Affected: CLI Command Handler. Recommendation: Introduce command timeouts, progress bars, and graceful error handling with retries.

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. CLI Hanging Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem**: CLI commands were hanging due to incorrect module import paths in the lazy loader.
**Root Cause**: The CLILazyLoader was trying to import from specific files (e.g., `../../parser/readme-parser`) instead of the main index exports.
**Solution**: Updated import paths to use the correct module exports (`../../parser`, `../../detection`, `../../generator`).

### 2. Module Loading Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Dynamic imports were failing because the expected class names weren't being exported properly.
**Root Cause**: Import paths pointed to files that didn't export the expected classes.
**Solution**: Changed imports to use index files and added fallback to `module.default` for ES modules.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made

1. **Fixed CLILazyLoader import paths**:
   - Changed from `../../parser/readme-parser` to `../../parser`
   - Changed from `../../detection/framework-detector` to `../../detection`
   - Changed from `../../generator/yaml-generator` to `../../generator`

2. **Added fallback handling for ES module exports**:
   - Updated getter methods to handle both named exports and default exports
   - Added `|| module.default` fallback for compatibility

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

- CLI commands should no longer hang
- `--help` command should display properly
- Core parsing functionality should work through the CLI
- Module lazy loading should complete successfully

## ðŸ§ª Testing Required

Please test the following commands:
```bash
# Test help command
readme-to-cicd --help

# Test parsing command
readme-to-cicd parse README.md

# Test basic generation
readme-to-cicd generate --dry-run
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

Once CLI stability is confirmed, proceed to:
- Phase 2: Debug integration pipeline connection problems
- Phase 3: Fix command-language association and context inheritance

## UI/UX Issues
- **Missing ARIA** (High): The webview interface lacks proper ARIA labels and roles, making it inaccessible to screen readers and users with disabilities. Affected: Webview UI Components. Recommendation: Audit and add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements following WCAG guidelines.
- **Config Overflow** (Medium): Long configuration options in the UI panel cause text overflow and horizontal scrolling on smaller viewports. Affected: Configuration Panel. Recommendation: Implement responsive typography, truncation with tooltips, and flexible grid layouts.

## Performance Issues
- **Excessive Load Times** (High): The extension's initial activation and workflow preview loading take several seconds, frustrating users during setup. Affected: Extension Activation and Preview Renderer. Recommendation: Optimize bundle size, defer non-critical loads, and use caching for repeated operations.
- **Concurrency Bottlenecks** (Medium): Simultaneous generation of multiple workflows leads to queuing and delays due to shared resources. Affected: Multi-Workflow Coordinator. Recommendation: Refactor to use worker threads or async queues for parallel processing without blocking the main thread.

## Security Issues
- **Absolute Path Access** (Medium): The file system manager permits access to absolute paths outside the workspace, risking exposure of sensitive system files. Affected: File System Manager. Recommendation: Enforce path resolution to workspace boundaries and validate all file operations.
- **Missing CSP** (Medium): Webviews do not implement Content Security Policy, allowing potential XSS attacks via injected scripts. Affected: Webview Hosting. Recommendation: Set strict CSP headers in webview postMessage handlers and sanitize all inputs.
- **Internal Eval** (Low): Certain YAML parsing routines use eval() for dynamic expression evaluation, introducing code injection risks. Affected: YAML Validation Service. Recommendation: Replace eval() with a safe AST parser or library like js-yaml with safe loading options.

## Compatibility Issues
- **Extension Types Mismatch** (Low): TypeScript type definitions for VSCode APIs do not fully align with runtime behaviors in older VSCode versions, causing subtle type errors. Affected: TypeScript Integration and API Mocks. Recommendation: Use conditional types based on VSCode version and update mocks to match documented API changes.
