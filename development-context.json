  "reasoning": "MAJOR PROGRESS: TypeScript compilation errors have been completely resolved! The project now compiles successfully. However, the core integration between CommandExtractor and LanguageDetector remains broken, causing 202 test failures (16.3% failure rate). The IntegrationPipeline exists but has dependency issues preventing proper component communication. Since compilation is working, we should continue fixing the integration issues rather than switching contexts.",
