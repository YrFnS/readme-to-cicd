  "reasoning": "The core integration between LanguageDetector and CommandExtractor is broken, causing 176 test failures. This is a critical blocking issue that prevents the system from working correctly. The IntegrationPipeline exists but isn't being used by ReadmeParserImpl. While there are many linting issues, they are quality improvements that can be deferred. The missing components (Framework Detection, YAML Generator, CLI Tool) are expected gaps planned for future implementation.",
