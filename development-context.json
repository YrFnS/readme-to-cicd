  "reasoning": "The core integration fixes spec shows all tasks are marked complete, but the test suite reveals fundamental integration problems. 180 test failures indicate that the CommandExtractor-LanguageDetector integration is broken - commands are not inheriting language context properly. This is a critical blocking issue that must be fixed before proceeding with other components. TypeScript compilation passes, which is good, but the integration is fundamentally broken.",
  "nextAction": "Fix the CommandExtractor language association issue - commands are missing the 'language' property and not inheriting context from LanguageDetector. Focus on the integration between these two components first.",
