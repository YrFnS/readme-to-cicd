  "reasoning": "CLI tool tasks 1-7 are marked as completed in the spec, but 279 tests are failing, many in CLI components. The user has output-handler.test.ts open, which contains failing tests for task 7. These test failures indicate that the 'completed' features aren't actually working properly, blocking progress on task 8 (workflow validation). The failing tests must be fixed before continuing with new spec tasks.",
  "nextAction": "Fix the failing tests in CLI components, starting with output-handler.test.ts since it's currently open. Focus on file conflict resolution, merge strategies, and path validation issues.",
