  "reasoning": "The system has critical integration failures with 181 failing tests. The core README parser components exist but are not properly connected. CommandExtractor is not receiving language context from LanguageDetector, IntegrationPipeline is not being used by ReadmeParserImpl, and confidence scoring is broken. These are not expected gaps from future work - these are broken implementations that must be fixed before any new development can proceed. The linting issues are quality improvements that can be deferred.",
