  "reasoning": "The VSCode extension implementation is significantly more advanced than the tasks.md file indicates. Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 are actually completed based on the implemented code (ExtensionManager, CommandManager, SettingsManager, FileWatcherManager, and package.json configuration). The tasks.md file shows only Tasks 1-2 as complete, but the implementation summary and actual code show much more progress. TypeScript compilation is successful with no errors. The test setup issue is not blocking development progress.",
