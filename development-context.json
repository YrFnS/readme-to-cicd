  "reasoning": "Task 15 'Create main generator orchestration' is marked as completed (âœ…) but has 9 blocking TypeScript compilation errors in yaml-generator.ts that prevent the code from running. These are implementation bugs in supposedly completed work that must be fixed before proceeding with task 16 or any other spec work. The test failures and missing features are expected gaps that will be addressed in future tasks.",
  "nextAction": "Fix the TypeScript compilation errors in src/generator/yaml-generator.ts by: 1) Adding missing 'reloadOnChange' property to TemplateManager constructor, 2) Passing templateManager parameter to all generator constructors, 3) Adding null checks for coordination.dependencies, 4) Fixing GenerationOptions type issues",
